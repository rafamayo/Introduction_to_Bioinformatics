## Week 4 Assignment: Genomics and Genome Analysis

### Title: Genome Assembly and Annotation

**Motivation:**

Genome analysis is a cornerstone of bioinformatics, providing insights into the genetic makeup of organisms. This assignment aims to introduce students to the processes of genome assembly and annotation, essential skills for any bioinformatics practitioner. Understanding these techniques will help students appreciate the complexity and scope of genomics research.

**Goals:**

1. Learn the principles and steps involved in genome assembly.
2. Gain practical experience with genome annotation.
3. Understand the challenges and solutions in assembling and annotating a genome.

**Tasks to Perform:**

1. **Genome Assembly:**
 
  - Step 1: Download a set of short-read sequencing data (FASTQ files) from a public repository such as the NCBI SRA (Sequence Read Archive). For this assignment, use a small bacterial genome dataset (e.g., Escherichia coli).

  - Step 2: Use the SPAdes assembler to assemble the downloaded reads into contigs.

  - Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the assembled contigs using QUAST (Quality Assessment Tool for Genome Assemblies).

  - Step 4: Report the following details:

    - Number of contigs produced
    - N50 value
    - Total length of the assembled genome
    - Any observed issues or limitations in the assembly process
