## Week 4 Assignment: Genomics and Genome Analysis

### Title: Genome Assembly and Annotation

**Motivation:**

Genome analysis is a cornerstone of bioinformatics, providing insights into the genetic makeup of organisms. This assignment aims to introduce students to the processes of genome assembly and annotation, essential skills for any bioinformatics practitioner. Understanding these techniques will help students appreciate the complexity and scope of genomics research.

**Goals:**

1. Learn the principles and steps involved in genome assembly.
2. Gain practical experience with genome annotation.
3. Understand the challenges and solutions in assembling and annotating a genome.

**Tasks to Perform:**

1. **Genome Assembly:**
 
  - **Step 1:** Download a set of short-read sequencing data (FASTQ files) from a public repository such as the NCBI SRA (Sequence Read Archive). For this assignment, use a small bacterial genome dataset (e.g., Escherichia coli).

  - **Step 2:** Use the SPAdes assembler to assemble the downloaded reads into contigs.

  - **Step 3:** Evaluate the quality of the assembled contigs using QUAST (Quality Assessment Tool for Genome Assemblies).

  - **Step 4:** Report the following details:

    - Number of contigs produced
    - N50 value
    - Total length of the assembled genome
    - Any observed issues or limitations in the assembly process

2. **Genome Annotation:**

 - Step 1: Use the Prokka tool to annotate the assembled genome.
 - Step 2: Explore the output files generated by Prokka, focusing on the annotations provided for genes, coding sequences (CDS), tRNAs, rRNAs, and other features.
 - Step 3: Report the following details:
  - Total number of genes annotated
  - Number of protein-coding genes
  - Number of tRNAs and rRNAs
  - Examples of annotated genes and their predicted functions

3. **Discussion:**
   
 - Reflection on the challenges faced during genome assembly and annotation.
 - Importance of genome assembly and annotation in genomics research.
 - Insights gained from the assignment and potential improvements for future analyses.


**Expected Outcomes:**

 - Students will understand the steps involved in genome assembly and annotation.
 - Students will be able to use SPAdes and Prokka tools to assemble and annotate a small bacterial genome.
 - Students will be able to interpret the results of genome assembly and annotation, including assessing the quality of assemblies and understanding gene functions.


**Tools to Use:**

 - SPAdes: For genome assembly.
 - QUAST: For assessing the quality of genome assemblies.
 - Prokka: For genome annotation.
 - NCBI SRA: For downloading sequencing data.
 - Command Line Interface (CLI): To run SPAdes, QUAST, and Prokka tools.
